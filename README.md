# Il2CppDumper for Critical Ops

Here is a Unity Il2CppDumper I made that works for Critical Ops

Tested on iOS.


## Requirements

- You need to install [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-7.0.20-windows-x64-installer) in order to run
## Usage

Run `Il2CppDumper.exe` and choose the `il2cpp` executable file and `global-metadata.dat` file, then enter the information as prompted

The program will then generate all the output files in current working directory
